# Tunr App!

Have you ever thought spotify or soundcloud was a lame place to store your music? Me neither, but here is a new one anyways!

### How does it work?

Simply click "Add New Song" and fill out the form. Upon submission, you will see your song added to the page. If you wish to edit a sing, click the edit button and fill out the form. Currently the edit form does not autofill with your previous data, but otherwise it works normally. The delete button works as expected :D. Edit and delete do not rerender the page yet. Manually refresh the page to see your changes.
